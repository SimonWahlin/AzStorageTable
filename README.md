# AzStorageTable
PowerShell Core Version of AzureRmStorageTable by Paulo Marques (MSFT)

https://github.com/paulomarquesc/AzureRmStorageTable

This Module is a conversion of AzureRmStorageTable to work with PowerShell Core.

The biggest change is that AzureRmStorageTable is a syncronous implementation and this version is an asyncronous implementation. 

The reason is that .NET Core does not have the syncronous Api's.
